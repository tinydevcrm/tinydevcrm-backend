# Flight rules

## What are flight rules?

A guide for core developers and core maintainers of `tinydevcrm-dashboard` about
what to do when things go wrong.

>   *Flight rules* are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals
>   that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. Essentially, they
>   are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures.
>
>   NASA has been capturing our missteps, disasters, and solutions since the
>   early 1960s, when Mercury-era ground teams first started gathering "lessons
>   learned" into a compendium that now lists thousands of problematic
>   situations, from engine failure to busted hatch handles to computer
>   glitches, and their solutions.
